### 🧠 About me

I’m a Computer Science M.Sc. student at **Universität Hamburg** with a strong interest in  
**cybersecurity, network analysis, and AI-assisted detection systems**.

I enjoy working on systems where you can *see what’s going on* — networks, traffic, devices,
models — and then gradually make sense of them.

---

### 🔧 Things I enjoy working on

- 🔐 Network & system security  
- 📡 Traffic analysis, IoT & smart-home environments  
- 🤖 Applied ML / LLMs for security & time-series data  
- 🐳 Docker, CI pipelines, and reproducible setups  
- 📊 Neat visualizations that actually explain something

### 🚀 Current status

💼 **Open to work**  
I’m actively looking for **full-time roles** in  
**cybersecurity, networks, or applied ML**.

📍 Germany · Ready to move · Remote-friendly
