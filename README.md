### 🧠 About me

I’m a Computer Science M.Sc. student at **Universität Hamburg** with a strong interest in  
**cybersecurity, network analysis, and AI-assisted detection systems**.

I like projects where you can *see* what’s going on — traffic flows, devices talking to each other,
models making decisions — and then slowly take them apart until they make sense.

Sometimes that involves graphs.  
Sometimes Docker.  
Sometimes Wireshark at 2 a.m.

### 🔧 Things I enjoy working on

- 🔐 Network & system security  
- 📡 Traffic analysis, IoT & smart-home environments  
- 🤖 Applied ML / LLMs for security & time-series data  
- 🐳 Docker, CI pipelines, and reproducible setups  
- 📊 Visualizations that actually explain something

---

### 📌 A few projects I’m proud of

- **Wi-Fi Network Visualization for Smart Homes**  
  My bachelor thesis: visualizing and controlling smart-home devices with Home Assistant integration.

- **NutriNube (Cloud Computing Project)**  
  Team-based Flask app with Docker, CI/CD, and proper testing.

- **Security & Networking Exercises**  
  Practical coursework covering network security, databases, and systems.

(If something looks experimental — it probably is. That’s intentional.)

### 🚀 Current status

💼 **Open to work**  
I’m actively looking for **internships, thesis projects, research positions, or full-time roles**  
in the areas of **cybersecurity, networks, or applied ML**.

📍 Germany / Remote-friendly

That’s because learning is not a linear process.
